# Adding new home environments
Starting with the Windows 2018 Spring Creators update (OS Version 1804) you can travel between the Cliff House and Skyloft environments using the places picker. We've also enabled an experimental feature that lets you add new environments to your places picker, including your own creations!
<br>Custom environments expand the creative possibilities of Windows Mixed Reality. When using custom environments you'll notice that teleporting, interacting with apps, and placing holograms works just like it does in the Cliff House and skyloft. Custom environments simiply give you the flexiblity to change the backdrop for your experience in the Windows Mixed Reality home. Travel to a fantastic world to browse the web, or fill a futuristic world with holograms from the Holograms app.
## Getting started
We've created 3 sample environments that show off some of some of the creative possibilites of custom envrionments. To get started:

## Troubleshooting and tips

The file name in the environments folder will be used in the places picker. To change the name of your environment simply rename the environment and then restart the Mixed Reality Portal
### How do I remove custom environments from my places picker?
To remove a custom environment simply open up the environments app folder on your PC and delete the environment. Once you restart the Mixed Reality portal this environment will no longer appear in the places picker.
